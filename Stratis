Manage storage using the Stratis local storage management system 

Managing Layered Storage with Stratis :

#yum install stratis-cli stratisd
#systemctl enable --now stratisd
#stratis pool create pool1 /dev/vdb
#stratis pool list
#stratis pool add-data pool1 /dev/vdc
#stratis pool list

#stratis blockdev list pool1

#stratis filesystem create pool1 fs1
#stratis filesystem list
#stratis filesystem snapshot pool1 fs1 snapshot1
#stratis filesystem list  (it mention snap)


#mkdir /mountpoint
#mount /stratis/pool1/fs1 /mountpoint

#lsblk --output=UUID /startis/pool1/f1
	31b9363b-add8-4b46-a4bf-c199cd478c55
#vi /etc/fstab
UUID=31...55 /mountpoint  xfs defaults,xsystemd.requires=stratisd.service 0 0

#mkdir /stratisvol-snap
#mount /startis/pool1/snapshot1  /stratisvol-snap

Create a 2 GiB file on fs1
#dd if=/dev/urandom of=/mountpoint/file1 bs=1M count=2048
#stratis filesystem list
#tail /stratisvol-snap/file1

#umount /stratisvol-snap
#umount /mountpoint
#stratis filesystem destroy pool1 snapshot1
#stratis filesystem destroy pool1 fs1


Therefore, the file system might appear to be 1 TiB in size, but might only have 100 GiB of
real storage actually allocated to it from the pool.


If you do not include the x-systemd.requires=stratisd.service mount
option in /etc/fstab for each Stratis file system, the machine will fail to start
properly and will abort to emergency.target the next time it is rebooted.

The df command will report that any new Stratis-managed XFS file systems are
1 TiB in size, no matter how much physical storage is currently allocated to the
file system.

Stratis-managed file systems are formatted using XFS.
you can create up to 224 file systems per pool.

In Stratis, file systems are built from shared pools of disk devices using a concept known as thin-provisioning.
